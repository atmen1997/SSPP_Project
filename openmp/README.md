## Overview
This project involves running parallel matrix multiplication using OpenMP and job submission using PBS. The following instructions guide you through running the necessary scripts for the setup and execution of the tasks.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have access to an HPC system with OpenMP support.
- Ensure that the `openmp.sh` and `qsub.sh` scripts are in the same directory.
- You must have the necessary permissions to execute these scripts on your system.
- Ensure that the required modules (such as OpenMP) are available on your system.

## Running the Scripts

### Step 1: Run `openmp.sh`

The first script to run is `openmp.sh`. This script initializes the OpenMP environment and prepares the required setup for matrix multiplication using parallel processing.

1. Open a terminal in the directory where the scripts are located.
2. Execute the following command to run the `openmp.sh` script: 
./openmp.sh

This will set up the environment for the OpenMP matrix multiplication and ensure that the necessary configurations are in place.

### Step 2: Submit the Job with `qsub.sh`

After running the `openmp.sh` script, you can submit your job using the `qsub.sh` script. This script submits your job to the job scheduler (PBS) for execution.

1. Once `openmp.sh` has completed successfully, you can submit your job by running:
./qsub.sh

This will submit your job to the scheduler and execute the parallel matrix multiplication job using OpenMP on the available resources.

### Output
- After the job has finished, you can check the output files generated by the job. These will include any performance logs or results from the matrix multiplication computations.
